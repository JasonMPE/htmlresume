# What is this about?

Just a resume held in a HTML5 file. Hopes to become a template for doing resume, just like the one for doing presentation (http://slides.html5rocks.com/).

One particular objective of this template is to prevent user from doing the CSS styling right inside the HTML. The layout of this template utilizes the grid framework from Blueprint CSS. CSS classes are injected to HTML elements in js/scripts.js "Content Layout" section. Other styles other than using the grid layout are defined in css/style.css following the HTML5 Boilerplate guidelines.


# Depends on...

* http://html5boilerplate.com/ - The starting kit of this stuff.
* http://www.blueprintcss.org/ - A css framework with easy-to-use grid.
* https://github.com/addywaddy/jquery.tagcloud.js - A Simple Tag Cloud Plugin for JQuery.
